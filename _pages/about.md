Hi! My name is Wojtek. 
I'am a big fan of Windows PowerShell/ PowerShell, and mainly about that I want to write on this blog ‚ò∫Ô∏è

My IT journey started in 2013. Right after when I finished my high school, I landed in small company (my Boss and I) which serve IT services (outsourcing).

I started work for bigger company where I provided IT support as Junior IT Admin
I supported almost everything, from access control devices, through computers, servers to power supplies (UPS)

It comes a time where I consider to change the place where I work, I learnt a lot, and I felt it's a right time!
That's how I started work for company where I supported an applications
Here I fall in love with PowerShell üòâ to automate every repetitive task! 

The blog is a kind of nootebok, and I regret that I started doing this so late 
 
with the PowerShell greeting üòâ
